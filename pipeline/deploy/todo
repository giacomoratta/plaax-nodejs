GOAL: final ci/cd setup

- diff deploy-wf by ENV
  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#example-usage-of-the-vars-context
  - keep it simple: work on a single file based on DEV environment
  - more complex things in the future

- fix local scripts for deployment
- run scripts without full path (just ./pipeline/...)

- rename "pipeline" to "scripts" or "ci_cd_scripts"?

- clean actions
- update docs and planning

--------------------------------------------

create a directory "deploy"
create a directory "deploy-static"
move plaax-stack.aws-cfn.operations.sh
move plaax-stack.aws-cfn.yml
move plaax-stack-static.aws-cfn.operations.sh
move plaax-stack-static.aws-cfn.yml
use plaax-stack.aws-cfn.operations.sh into gh-wf! with --deploy and other options
>> it's just one operation! the deployment


--------------------------------------------

add in "TODO-list"
- create github action to copy a release when PR is merged into main to "plaax-release-main"
- replace current s3 plaax-dev-release with plaax-temp-release
- deal with weekly operations (fix vulnerabilities, package updates, etc.)
