why splitting? to make reusable small steps for build, test, release!

implement removal of same release-hash with s3
> integrate in built-release steps
> then, remove RELEASE_HASH_TO_DELETE (from local / replace with s3 remove)

--------------------------------------------

create a directory "deploy"
create a directory "deploy-static"
move plaax-stack.aws-cfn.operations.sh
move plaax-stack.aws-cfn.yml
move plaax-stack-static.aws-cfn.operations.sh
move plaax-stack-static.aws-cfn.yml
use plaax-stack.aws-cfn.operations.sh into gh-wf! with --deploy and other options
>> it's just one operation! the deployment


--------------------------------------------

add timestamp to releases
select newest one based on prefix with hash
set an auto-removal policy
or create a script to remove old releases


add in "TODO-list"
- create github action to copy a release when PR is merged into main to "plaax-release-main"
- replace current s3 plaax-dev-release with plaax-temp-release
