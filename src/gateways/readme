When accessing external resources like this, you'll usually get APIs for them. However, these APIs are naturally going
to be somewhat complicated because they take the nature of the resource into account. Anyone who needs to under-stand a
resource needs to understand its API - whether JDBC and SQL for rela-tional databases or W3C or JDOM for XML.

Not only does this make the software harder to understand, it also makes it much harder to change should you shift some
data from a relational database to an XML message at some point in the future.

The answer is so common that it's hardly worth stating. Wrap all the special API code into a class whose interface looks
like a regular object. Other objects access the resource through this Gateway, which translates the simple method calls
into the appropriate specialized API.
